# JavaScript-The-Advanced-Concepts

https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-javascript-concepts

## Some of the topics covered in this course are:

1. Javascript Engine: A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript (JS) code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance. JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one.

2. Javascript Runtime: Javascript runtime refers to where your javascript code is executed when you run it. That said, javascript can be executed on google chrome, in which case your javascript runtime is v8, if on mozilla - it is spidermonkey, if IE - then its chakra and if on node, again its v8.

3. Interpreter, Compiler, JIT Compiler: 
     a. AOT compiler - Ahead-of-Time (AOT): compiles before running
     b. JIT compiler - Just-in-Time (JIT) : compiles while running
     c. interpreter: runs - REPL â€” read-eval-print-loop.

4. Writing Optimized Code: So there is a thing called cloud. When we do a webpack build, it gets stored in cloud and our js code gets served from the cloud when user requests it. Now the cloud sends us JavaScript file, which is a junk of text basically and now to make sense it goes through a parser which parses the JavaScript file and converts it to an AST(Abstract Syntax Tree). You can think of AST as data-structure that represents what this code really means.
Now the V8 compilers take care of rest of the work. So the first step is interpreter which interprets the code and identify the hotspots which I mentioned earlier and generates semi-optimized bytecode. Any code that can be optimized then goes to the optimizing compiler. Then the optimizing compiler analyzes the code and make assumptions to make it even faster. The optimizing compiler generates highly optimized machine code, but we discussed that sometimes it has to de-optimize on runtime and change back to the byte code. Hats off to the naming of V8 team, they really know how to name their engines. The interpreter which generates the bytecode is called Ignition (yes the ignition of the car, i.e. the start) and the optimizing compiler is called TurboFan (turbo boost which speeds up the car).
